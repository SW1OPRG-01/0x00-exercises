## Exercise 1
1. Open the file `exercise_1.cpp`.
2. Define a variable of type `int` called `weight`. Assume the unit is `[kg]`.
3. Define a variable of type `double` called `height`. Assume the unit is `[m]`.
4. Initialize `weight` and `height` with appropiate values.
5. Define a variable of type `double` called `bmi` and initialize it to `weight/height * 2`.

Then write `BMI for weight: <weight> and height: <height> is <bmi>` to the console output.

Test your program by changing the values for `height` and `weight`, rebuilding, and running the program from the terminal.
